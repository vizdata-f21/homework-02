```{r load-pac-data}
# get a list of files with "Foreign Connected PAC" in their names
list_of_files <- dir_ls(path = "data", regexp = "Foreign Connected PAC")

# read all files and row bind them
# keeping track of the file name in a new column called year
pac <- read_csv(list_of_files, id = "year")
```
